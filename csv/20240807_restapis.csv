What does REST stand for?|Real-time State Transfer|Representational State Transfer|Remote Exchange Server Technology|Routing and Extensions Standard Technology|Representational State Transfer|REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications, relying on stateless, client-server, and cacheable communications protocols.|REST|basics|architecture|restapis1
Which HTTP method is typically used to retrieve data from a server?|POST|DELETE|PUT|GET|GET|The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect.|REST|HTTP methods|GET|restapis2
What does a 404 HTTP status code signify?|Server error|Success|Resource not found|Redirection|Resource not found|A 404 status code indicates that the server could not find the requested resource. It is often returned when the resource does not exist on the server.|REST|HTTP status codes|error handling|restapis3
What protocol is commonly used with REST APIs?|FTP|SMTP|HTTP|SNMP|HTTP|REST APIs commonly use the HTTP protocol to facilitate communication between the client and server.|REST|protocols|communication|restapis4
Which HTTP method is used to update a specific resource on the server?|GET|POST|DELETE|PUT|PUT|The PUT method is used to update a specific resource on the server, completely replacing it with the data provided in the request.|REST|HTTP methods|PUT|restapis5
What does the HTTP method DELETE do?|Creates a resource|Updates a resource|Deletes a resource|Fetches a resource|Deletes a resource|The DELETE method removes the specified resource from the server.|REST|HTTP methods|DELETE|restapis6
What is the purpose of HTTP headers in a REST API?|To store resources|To manage sessions|To provide metadata about the request and response|To control access to the server|To provide metadata about the request and response|HTTP headers provide essential metadata about the request and response, such as content type, status, and caching policies.|REST|HTTP headers|metadata|restapis7
What does the Content-Type header specify?|The size of the content|The type of content being sent|The method to be used|The language of the content|The type of content being sent|The Content-Type header indicates the media type of the resource or the data in the request body.|REST|HTTP headers|content types|restapis8
What is the typical purpose of a POST request in a REST API?|To delete a resource|To create a new resource|To update an existing resource|To fetch data|To create a new resource|The POST method is used to create a new resource on the server, often by sending data in the request body.|REST|HTTP methods|POST|restapis9
What does idempotency mean in the context of REST APIs?|An operation that can be safely repeated|An operation that always fails|An operation that uses authenticated requests|An operation that logs user actions|An operation that can be safely repeated|In REST APIs, idempotency means that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request.|REST|concepts|idempotency|restapis10
Which HTTP status code indicates a successful request?|400|200|500|301|200|A 200 status code indicates that the request was successful and the server has returned the requested resource.|REST|HTTP status codes|success|restapis11
What is a resource in RESTful services?|A database entry|A user session|A server function|Any identifiable entity on the server|Any identifiable entity on the server|In RESTful services, a resource is any identifiable entity that can be manipulated via HTTP methods.|REST|basics|resources|restapis12
Which of the following is a valid endpoint for a RESTful API?|/api|/api/resource|/getResource|/postAPI|/api/resource|A valid RESTful API endpoint typically follows the pattern of '/api/{resource}', where {resource} is the specific resource being accessed.|REST|endpoints|best practices|restapis13
What is the use of the Accept header in an HTTP request?|To specify the HTTP method|To define the request's language|To indicate the desired response format|To manage caching|To indicate the desired response format|The Accept header tells the server what media types the client is capable of understanding, guiding the content negotiation process.|REST|HTTP headers|response format|restapis14
What is HATEOAS in REST architecture?|A server configuration tool|A security protocol|An API testing framework|A principle encouraging hypertext-driven applications|A principle encouraging hypertext-driven applications|Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS) is a way to make API interactions discoverable by including hypermedia links with responses.|REST|concepts|HATEOAS|restapis15
Which HTTP status code indicates a client-side error?|201|403|500|200|403|A 403 status code indicates that the client does not have the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.|REST|HTTP status codes|client errors|restapis16
What is the primary benefit of using REST APIs?|Built-in security, Slow performance, Statelessness, Complex implementation|Statelessness|Statelessness means that each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request, improving scalability.|REST|basics|benefits|restapis17
How is versioning typically handled in REST APIs?|Using database schemas|Embedding version numbers in URLs|Through user authentication|By changing HTTP methods|Embedding version numbers in URLs|Versioning in REST APIs is commonly handled by including the version number in the URL path (e.g., /api/v1/resource).|REST|best practices|versioning|restapis18
What is the best practice for defining endpoints in REST API?|Using action verbs|Using plural nouns for resources|Using single letters|Combining multiple resources in one endpoint|Using plural nouns for resources|Endpoints in REST APIs should be defined using plural nouns to represent resources (e.g., /users), ensuring clarity and consistency.|REST|endpoints|best practices|restapis19
Which HTTP status code means "Created"?|200|404|201|500|201|A 201 status code indicates that a request has been fulfilled and a new resource has been created as a result.|REST|HTTP status codes|creation|restapis20
