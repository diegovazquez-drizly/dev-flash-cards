Generate a csv file with the following structure: question, answer_1, answer_2, answer_3, answer_4, correct_answer, detailed_answer, tag_1, tag_2, tag_3

The CSV should have 25 rows.

populate each row with a unique question that a full stack web developer might be asked in an interview. the technology that should be asked about is React.js.

for each row, generate 4 answer choices, with 3 of them being incorrect and one correct. all of the above should not be an answer choice.

the correct answer row should contain the correct answer. there should only be one correct answer.

the detailed answer row should contain a paragraph that explains the correct answer with more detail.

add 3 tags that allow the questions to be grouped

use | as the delimiter

the output should be a csv file. don't show me code, just the csv.
